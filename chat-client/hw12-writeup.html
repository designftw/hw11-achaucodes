                            <p>
                                For the final design of my chat app, I am planning on implementing all the key features designed in my mockup.
                                These features include reminders to respond to messages, organizational conversation categories, as well as 
                                temporary pinning within groupchats. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, although the functionality will remain similar to the mockup, the appearance of the app will be different. 
                                My mockup was designed for an iPhone screen, which is much different than a laptop screen. Therefore, I will utilize the 
                                extra space that was not possible in my mockup. For example, I will display all conversation categories at once in a navigational header rather than use a dropdown. 
                            </p>

                                A significant portion of my chat app implementation relies on the creation of conversations, both to individuals and to groups. 
                                Before any of the unique features could be implemented, I had to implement a main page with clickable conversation previews, implement a 
                                chat creation interface, provide transitions from previews to conversations and vice versa, etc. This can be seen in Figure 1 below.

                                After laying down the foundation, I implemented being able to select conversations in order to perform actions on them, 
                                as well as half-implemented the conversation category organization feature. This included creating category headings,
                                method skeletons, and the process for moving conversations to categories. This can be seen in the video in Figure 2 below.

                                Overall, the progress I made this week represents half of the work I need to do. The most time-consuming process was
                                implementing a functional group-creation interface, laying the foundation for the rest of my chat app. After becoming more 
                                and more comfortable with graffiti, I believe that the rest of my implementation will go relatively quickly. Although a lot of my 
                                work this week was not directly implementing my key features, I believe it was significant, essential, and the most difficult part of 
                                the project. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a result, the next steps for my implementaiton include: finishing the conversation category system, implementing reminders to respond, 
                                as well as adding temporary pinning functionality.
