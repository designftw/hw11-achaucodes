                            <p>
                                The goal of my messaging app is to provide private messaging similar to iMessage, while providing a design that eliminates memory slips. 
                                It is designed for people who text family, friends, and other individuals frequently. 
                                Its features focus on eliminating slips such as forgetting to respond or missing important messages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The key features of my app include grouping messages that haven't been responded to, 
                                pinning messages, and being able to set reminders to respond.
                                Additionally, my app provides similar functionality that other messaging apps do, including the ability to create 
                                groupchats, reply to messages, like messages, etc.
                            </p>
							
						<h2 id="not-responded">Not Responded Category</h2>
                            <p>
                                As seen in Figure 1, my app groups conversations into three categories: "All", "Not Responded", and "Pinned".
                                The purpose of these groups is to increase efficiency when searching for important messages, as well as to 
                                prevent memory slips by grouping all not-responded-to conversations in one place.
                            </p>

                        <h2 id="reminders">Reminders To Respond</h2>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/app-reminders.png"/>
                                <figcaption>Figure 2. Setting reminders infrastructure.</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>
                                Figure 2 shows the setting reminders to respond part of my interface.
                                Reminders appear at the times they are set for in the details dropdown at the top
                                of the page. Reminders can be set both in the 'All' and 'Not Responded' groups of 
                                conversations. There are two options for setting times to respond: "at" for "at a specific time",
                                and "in" for "in a number of hours". 
                                The user can set reminders for multiple conversations at once due to the 
                                check-box select implementation.  
                            </p>
                        
                        <h2 id="pinning">Message Pinning</h2>
                            <figure>
                                <img class="pin" src="images/app-pin-symbol.png"/>
                                <img class="pin" src="images/app-pinned-messages.png"/>
                                <figcaption>Figure 3. Pinning messages implementation.</figcaption>
                            </figure>

                            <p>
                                Messages are pinned by clicking the "Pin ðŸ“Œ" button. All pinned messages are displayed in the 
                                "Pinned Messages" category. This is to consolidate all important messages into one location for efficiency.
                            </p>

                        <h2 id="other">Other Features</h2>

                            </figure>

                            <p>
                                Other features include a scroll-to-top button, and a nice creating-a-new-conversation interface (see Figure 4).
                            </p>
